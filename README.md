# üì° Detection Class research project - Work In Progress


Welcome to the README for my research project focusing on the article titled "The CFAR Adaptive Subspace Detector is a Scale-Invariant GLRT", written by S.Kraut and L.L. Scharf. This project is conducted as part of my coursework in Detection within the Signals and Systems module at ISAE-Supaero, under the guidance of Professor St√©phanie Bidon.

## üìù Project Overview 

In this research, the goal is to study a precise detector, the Adaptive Subspace Detector (ASD), particularly explored by L.L. Scharf and L.T. McWhorter in their conference paper "Adaptive matched subspace detectors and adaptive coherence estimators" from 1996. It was a particular breakthrough in detection cases with unknown covariance matrices. I wrote some examples of basic detectors, implemented the method of the article and studied its performance.


## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure 

The project is structured as follows:

- **Examples** A few example files following cases of scalar and vectorial Neyman-Pearson and Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR) test.

- **CFAR_ASD_GLR** The main implementation of the computations made in the article

- **Report** All the context studied, some details about the article (computation of the diverse densities etc...) and the results found after simulation.

## ü§ù How to Contribute 

Contributions and suggestions are welcome. If you have insights, ideas, or resources that could enhance the project, please feel free to reach out.
